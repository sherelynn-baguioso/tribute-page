          Here's a time line of Florence Nightingale's life:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1820</strong> - Born in Florence, Italy.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1837</strong> - Felt God called to serve him and believed
            that nursing was her calling and divine purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1844</strong>
            - Enrolled as a nursing student at Lutheran Hospital of Pastor
            Fliedner in Kaiserwerth, Germany.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1850</strong>
            - Returned to london and took a nursing job in a Middlesex hospital
            for ailing governesses. Her performance got her promoted as
            superintendent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1853</strong>
            - Took the post as a superintendent at Institute for the Care of
            Sick Gentlewomen in Upper Harley Street, London.

            - Sent to Crimea to attend to the sick and fallen soldiers, together
            with her assembled team of Nurses. She was then named "Lady with the
            Lamp" as she makes her evening rounds carrying a lamp in the dark
            hallways. Also, her impressive work with sanitation helped reduce
            infections which led to a decrease in mortality rate by two-thirds.
